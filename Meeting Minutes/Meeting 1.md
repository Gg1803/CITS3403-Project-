# Meeting 1

## Agenda
Accounting for:
In the week 28th April-2nd May, at least one person from your group will need to turn up to a lab session for a 5 minute presentation. This should involve describing your idea to the facilitator and presenting designs for your GUI. These should consist of static HTML pages with some minimal CSS styling. No actual functionality required (e.g. button presses required, and complex graphs etc. can have placeholders).

- Deliverable
- Deciding on an idea
- Discuss on which CSS Framework to use
- Discuss on individual strengths, as well as individual and common goals for the project (eg. if someone's good at designing please let us know, though it's obviously completely fine if you would like to work on something else just to strengthen your portfolio)
- Create initial issues
- Discuss expectations for next meeting, as well as set-up next meeting time

## Deciding on an idea
For this project you are required to build a data analytics application, which allows users to upload private data, view automated analysis of their data and then selectively share the results with other users. You may interpret the concept of "data" and "analysis" very flexibly. 

Any method of data entry is fine. For example data could be manually entered by the user, or uploaded in batches in a suitable file format, or automatically sourced from other devices and services (e.g. fitness trackers, smart watches, publicly available feeds and datasets).
Please think carefully about the design of the application. It should be:
- Engaging, so that it looks good and focuses the user on important elements of the application.
- Effective, so it produces value for the user, by providing information, entertainment or community.
- Intuitive, so that it is easy for a user to use.

Any concept obeying the guidelines above is fine as long as the website offers the following views:
- An "introductory" view, describing the context and purpose of the application, and allowing the user to create an account or log in.
- An "upload data" view, allowing the user to add new data.
- A "visualise data" view, allowing user's to view analysis of either their data or other people's data which has been shared with them.
- A "share data" view, allowing the users to selectively share their data with other specific users.

### Designing website
