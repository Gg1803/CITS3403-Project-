# Meeting 2
### EZONE 102A Meeting Room. 2-4pm. 
- Attendance: All Present

## Meeting 2 Agenda:
- Review Liam's Design (would be good if we have the HEX, rgb for finalised colour schemes...)
- Allocate next task for frontend + backend (decide on what we'd like our basic "submittable" product to be - what we have to do to work towards that in the near future. also other future goals.)
- Create initial issues on GitHub (Smaller issues so we can implement changes gradually and won't have to wait on any of us - the first one should be creating basic pages with an extended nav bar so everything stays connected, no styling yet. Can make primary issues for us to tick off)
- See if the current ruleset works - I made a rule that prevents deletion of main on GitHub and prevents changes from being merged without approval (can try this with new minutes)

## Website Design
- All members are in agreement of the current website theme and overall design. 
- To add welcome page at the start.

## Initial Issues to be Created on GitHub
